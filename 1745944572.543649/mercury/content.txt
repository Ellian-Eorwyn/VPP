                   BGE’s Connected RewardsSM program helps decrease energy demand and emissions, keeps energy costs down for you and your neighbors, and rewards you each year you participate with a $50 prepaid card! During exceptionally hot or cold days, millions of cooling or heating appliances run at the same time. The demand for electricity adds stress to the grid, which may lead to higher energy costs, service interruptions and the release of pollutants that harm the environment. As a Connected Rewards participant, you’ll play an important role in protecting the environment and keeping energy costs down.Learn more about Connected Rewards    Common FAQs 

     

    During times when the demand for electricity is at its highest, BGE may briefly adjust your thermostat by up to 4 degrees. To show our appreciation, we’ll send you a one-time $50 prepaid card for each smart thermostat you register and another $50 prepaid card per eligible thermostat at the end of each season you participate.
