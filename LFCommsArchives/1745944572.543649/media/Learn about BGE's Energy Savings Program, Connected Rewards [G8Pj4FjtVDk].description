BGE’s Connected Rewards program helps decrease energy demand and emissions, keeps energy costs down for you and your neighbors, and rewards you each year you participate with a $50 Visa® eGift card! During exceptionally hot or cold days, millions of cooling or heating appliances run at the same time. The demand for electricity adds stress to the grid, which may lead to higher energy costs, service interruptions and the release of pollutants that harm the environment. As a Connected Rewards participant, you’ll play an important role in protecting the environment and keeping energy costs down.
