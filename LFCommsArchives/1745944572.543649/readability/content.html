        <div><p>BGE’s Connected Rewards<sup>SM</sup> program helps decrease energy demand and emissions, keeps energy costs down for you and your neighbors, and rewards you each year you participate with a $50 prepaid&nbsp;card! During exceptionally hot or cold days, millions of cooling or heating appliances run at the same time. The demand for electricity adds stress to the grid, which may lead to higher energy costs, service interruptions and the release of pollutants that harm the environment. As a Connected Rewards participant, you’ll play an important role in protecting the environment and keeping energy costs down.</p><p><a href="https://bgesmartenergy.com/residential/earn-incentives/connectedrewards/benefits">Learn more about Connected Rewards</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://bgesmartenergy.com/residential/earn-incentives/connectedrewards/faqs">Common FAQs</a></p></div><div>

Since the inception of the EmPOWER Maryland program in 2008, the programs have saved $14.5 billion on installed measures at a cost of $4.1 billion. In addition to new program costs, this charge includes paying off the uncollected costs that were accrued over time by programs required by the EmPOWER statute and authorized by the Commission. In accordance with House Bill 864 the uncollected amounts will be fully paid by the end of 2032.</p></div>
